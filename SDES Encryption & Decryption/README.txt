IS Assignment Task 1: SDES

Description:
The program is C++ based which includes a main.cpp file and a header (S_DES.h) file. The header file contains all of the functions within the S-DES system
needed to encrypt plaintext and decrypt ciphertext. The main.cpp file contains a menu which allows the user to select the following options; 1. Encryption, 
2. Decryption, 3. Help and 4. Exit. 
Encryption takes two inputs: 
i. The 10-bit key 
ii. The 8-bit plaintext
and outputs the encrypted ciphertext.

Decryption takes two inputs:
i. The 10-bit key
ii. The 8-bit ciphertext
and outs the decrypted plaintext. 

How to test:
Testing the program required me to test each function as I created them which helped me minimize errors while still being 
efficient. Each function in the S-DES system I coded has a line that is commented out, with a "TESTING PURPOSES ONLY" comment also beside it. To test each 
function, simply remove the first two "/" and run the code. I conclude that the program I wrote is successful as it produced the correct results as given
by the sample data.

Limitations:
The program fulfils all 3 requirements on the assignment sheet. There are also little to no limitations as there are validation checks on every keyboard 
input that is asked of the user. The only limitation is that the program hangs when the user enters a string when selecting a number from the menu.
